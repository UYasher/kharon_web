                    <h5>An escape from Hardware Hell</h5>
                    <p>
                        <b>Can you imagine a world where every time you wanted to connect to a server,
                            you had to write your own IP protocol?</b> It would be a huge hassle for the developers,
                        there would be an enormous chance that you might never be able to connect,
                        and the system would have inefficiencies and vulnerabilities galore. It would be a veritable
                        <b>Hell.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>And yet, that's what most hackers and devs accept </b> when they engage in hardware and IoT development.
                        They're programming across platforms, with few or little standards and plenty of scope for error.
                        <b>We fix that problem by taking care of hardware communication for you, simplifying your whole code base to python, and introducing a ton of efficiencies along the way.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>So in a technical sense, Kharon is batteries-included Hardware/IoT Development framework for python. <b><i>But really, Kharon is simplicity.</i></b></p>

                    <h1>Why Should I Use It?</h1>
                    <h5>There's a Cost to Chaos</h5>
                    <p>
                        By the end of 2018, the global IoT market will be worth <b>$1.4 Trillion dollars</b>. These
                        devices will be embedded in our homes, our cars, and our way of life. The market for hardware
                        based technology in general will be even larger. So when that technology messes up, the impact
                        will be equally large. In order to prevent such problems, we need systems that minimize points
                        of failure. <b>As such, simplifying technologies like Kharon can save money and lives.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>But the benefits are even more obvious if you are a developer. By abstracting away the hardest
                        part of hardware programming, your life becomes that much easier.</b> After all, Kharon's made
                        by devs, for devs. As a result it's intuitive and makes it easy to teach newer programmers IoT too!
